psync = persistant, p2p sync
  
Right now, it's neither :).  But, it has the sync engine it needs.  If you want persitant, just run the following every 5 minutes:

cd src
python psync.py source_directory destination_directory
python psync.py destination_directory source_directory


If you only want unidirectional sync, only run the first step.  Runnning both gives you bidirectional sync.


To get p2p sync, we'll need to get some networking logic in place.
